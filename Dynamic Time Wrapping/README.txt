Task 1
Description: 	For this task I built a function result = dtw(seq1, seq2) that takes as input two sequences then computes and returns the dynamic time warping (DTW) 
		distance between the sequences.

Task 2
Description: 	For this task I built a function [result, start_frame, end_frame] = dtw2(seq1, seq2) that takes as input two then computes and returns the 
		dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between the sequences as well as the start and end frames of the second sequence (seq2) that best represent
		the start and ending of the gesture encoded in seq1.


Files: 		dtw.m, dtw2.m

		**dtw.m file is necessary so that program dtw2.m can run successfully!**
