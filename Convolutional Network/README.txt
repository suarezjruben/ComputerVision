Task 1
Description: 	For this task I  trained and evaluated a convolutional neural network (CNN) as a face detector.

Task 2
Description: 	For this task I created a function cnn_detector_demo that detects faces in photos at multiple scales by using the face classification CNN that we trained in task 1.



Files: 		faces1000.mat, nonfaces1000.mat, task1.m, cnn_detector_demo.m, filter.mat, multiscale_correlation.m, make_bounding_box.m, draw_rectangle1.m, normalized_correlation.m, image_maximum.m

		**Must load mnist data**
		**All files are necessary for program to run successfully!**
