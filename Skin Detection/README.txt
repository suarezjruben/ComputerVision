Files: 	task1.m, detect_skin.m, gaussioan_probability.m, read_double_image.m, read_double_image2.m
	negatives.bin, positives.bin

task1.m		Displays plot of the evaluating of three different skin detection modules on some
		test data. The scrip was made to strictly work only with 2 or 3 trainning patches.
		3 different functions were implemented inside of the script as local functions in order
		to minimize code lines and facilitate data calculation for the different modules without
		repeating code. Scrip will run as intended as long as the above files are present in the
		same directory in addition to the images: test.bmp, training_A.bmp, and training_B.bmp.
