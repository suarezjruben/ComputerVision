Task 1
Description: 	For this task I computed an average two-image and an average three-image, by taking the average over many images displaying the digit 2 and the digit 3.
		The training data came from a public dataset that is called the MNIST dataset. 

Task 2
Description: 	For this task I utilized the average images from task one to detect the number 2 or 3 on test images usinz normalized correlation scores. Then I drew a squre on the
		best matching position, the pixel with highest corraltion scores. The pixel was returned as a 1x2 array.
